Talos is known to work on KVM.
We don't yet have a documented guide specific to KVM; however, you can follow the [General Getting Started Guide]({{< relref "../../../introduction/getting-started" >}}).
If you run into any issues, our [community](https://slack.dev.talos-systems.io/) can probably help!
