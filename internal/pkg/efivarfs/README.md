# efivarfs

This package was copied from the upstream repository at [efivarfs](https://github.com/monogon/monogon/tree/main/osbase/efivarfs)

There were minimal changes done to comply with the linter and gofmt rules.

The major change was to remove the EFI variable file immutable attribute before writing to it.
